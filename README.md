# MoodMonitorWatchApp
The Mood Monitor is a watchOS app that allows users to easily self-report their mood in the moment. 
The app also automatically gathers the user's sleep and activity data, and displays the daily moods, bedtimes, hours slept &amp; steps counts of the past week.
This is to help users better understand how their lifestyle choices (sleep and physical activity) influence their mood.
